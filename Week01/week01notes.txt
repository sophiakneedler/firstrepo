What is a file system?
A file system is the structure of an operating system. Its a way of separating data into files.
It's important to understand this because we need to know where files are to retrieve them and use them in code.

PWD (print working directory) command: prints the current directory path, starting from the root.

CD command: allows you to move between directories.

Relative file path: hierarchal path that locates a file or folder on a file system starting from the current directory.

Absolute file path: contains the root element and complete directory to locate a file.

. in file path: refers to the current folder.

.. in file path: referes to the folder that in one level heigher than the current folder.

Version control systems: software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
These allow you to compare files and their differences. They also allow you to merge changes prior to committing any code.

Repository: archive of the code that is being worked on.

Git: open source tool people install locally.

GitHub: Online service that developers who use Git can connect and upload/download reasources.
